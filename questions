- What is a histogram
 - a count of the number of occurrences, each time the algorithm is run
 - a count of how many cards are moved automatically histogram should range to at least 15
- What kind of writeup is the prof looking for? Should I discuss construction of the game?
-

--> wrietup, think of perspective of marker
 - state assumptions and decisons, describe, justify, discuss options
 - for the algorithm compare the different approaches

 write:
 - evaluate different algorithm options
 - talk about each one and decide which is best
 - impliment the best

 1. construction of testing environment
  - small
  - describe how it works
 2. algorithm options --> more important
  - options
  - which is the best, basically one correct answer, branch and bound
  - implement
  - describe and evaluate outputs
